Emacs Literate Configuration
======================

This is a emacs config based on:
https://github.com/gilbertw1/emacs-literate-starter
https://github.com/a13/emacs.d

### Usage

Install

    git clone https://github.com/mulkamanov/dotemacs.d.git ~/.emacs.d

### Notes

* I had to abandon precompilation, since it often led to difficulties in configuring packages (treemacs, lsp), and the startup time was reduced insignificantly.
